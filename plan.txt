Here is the comprehensive plan for executing the task of making the home page the index page:

### Plan:
1. **Review the Current Setup**: 
   - The `index.html` file is already named appropriately and serves as the home page with navigation links to other pages.

2. **Ensure Accessibility**:
   - Confirm that the `index.html` file is accessible as the main entry point for the application. This typically means ensuring it is located in the root directory of the web server.

3. **Verify Links**:
   - Check that the navigation links within the `index.html` file correctly point to the other pages (Gallery, Messages, Contact) and that they are functioning as expected.

4. **Testing**:
   - After confirming the setup, test the application by opening the `index.html` file in a web browser to ensure it displays correctly and that all links work.

5. **Follow-up Steps**:
   - If any issues are found during testing, address them accordingly. If everything works as expected, the task will be considered complete.
